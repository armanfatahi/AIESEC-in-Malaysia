            1930s</div>
        The idea behind AIESEC started in the 1930s, when representatives from schools across
        Europe exchanged information about various programs and schools that specialized
        in business and economics. Students were carrying out internships in other countries,
        but mostly on their own initiative, and it all came to a standstill with the onslaught
        of World War II. In 1944, though, the neutral Scandinavian countries were still
        exchanging: in Stockholm, BertilHedberg (official at the Stockholm School of Economics)
        and the two students JaroslavZich of Czechoslovakia and StanislasCallens of Belgium
        founded AIESE, the predecessor of AIESEC, which was officially founded in 1948.
        At the time, the mission was "to expand the understanding of a nation by expanding
        the understanding of the individuals, changing the world one person at a time."
        In 1949, 89 students participated in the so-called "Stockholm Congress", the first
        of many exchange programs.<br />

            1950s</div>
        In the late 1950s, AIESEC/Europe reached out to the United States and established
        contact with Yale University and Columbia Business School to see if either or both
        would help establish AIESEC in the United States. The result was that they sent
        three students (Perry Wurst, Norm Barnett and Stephen Keiley) on an exploratory
        mission to the annual International Conference in Cologne, Germany, in February
        1959. Upon their return home, these three students set up AIESEC chapters at both
        Yale and Columbia. In the summer of 1959, AIESEC/US exchanged twelve traineeships.
        The following year, AIESEC/US was expanded to six more colleges and exchanged more
        than thirty traineeships. Also AIESEC/US put forward the nomination of Morris Wolf
        to be the first General Secretary. He was elected as such and was part of establishing
        the first permanent international office for AIESEC in Geneva, Switzerland in 1960.
        He also contributed to AIESEC expanding to Ghana and Nigeria, And later Cameroon
        in 1958 in the city of Yaounde thereby establishing a beachhead for further expansion
        in Africa and opening the way for expansion to other continents. The following year,
        1961, it was turned into a Headquarter with the key mission to expand AIESEC. The
        first Secretary General was Victor Loewenstein, who spearheaded the expansion of
        the organization into South America.<br />

            1960s - 1990s</div>
        Soon, AIESEC became popular: by the end of 1960, 2467 exchanges were reported, and
        4232 by the end of 1970. A landmark in AIESEC history was the "International Theme
        Programme" that officially established all international, regional, and local seminars
        on specific topics, which in time grew to be a guideline for future AIESEC generations.
        In the following decades, debated topics were International Trade, Management Education,
        Sustainable development, Entrepreneurship, Innovation, and Corporate Social Responsibility.
        In the 1990s, intranets called Insight were established to facilitate networking.<br />

            2000s - Now</div>
        Today, AIESEC identifies itself as "the international platform for young people
        to explore and develop their leadership potential." It annually offers "24,000 leadership
        positions and delivers over 500 conferences to its membership of over 86,000 students".
        AIESEC also runs an international exchange program that enables over 20,000 students
        and recent graduates the opportunity to live and intern in another country."<br />
        2008 marked the 60th anniversary of AIESEC's founding. Celebrations occurred in
        London (January 2008), Tokyo (March 2008), Budapest (May 2008), Brussels (June 2008),
        Sao Paulo (August 2008), Stockholm (October 2008), and New York City (December 2008).<br />
        To maintain its relevance in the face of changing international relations, AIESEC
        expands the organization to new countries periodically, a process which is outlined
        in the organization's global compendium. Countries listed as "Official Extensions"
